      The Yale School of Art is a <strong>graduate school</strong> that confers MFAs in Graphic Design,
      Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College
      students. Our website exists as an <strong>ongoing collaborative experiment</strong> in digital publishing and
      information sharing. It functions as a wikiâ€”all members of the School of Art community have the ability to add new,
      and edit most existing content.
